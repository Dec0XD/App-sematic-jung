This can help to improve the accuracy of speaker diarization, especially in cases where the Whisper model may not take fine utterances like \"hmm\" and \"yeah\" into account, but the Diarization Model (Nemo) may include them, leading to inconsistent results.\n",

It ignores the comments and assigns the entire monologue to the speaker who is speaking the majority of the time. This provides a robust and reliable method for realigning speech segments to their respective speakers based on punctuation in the transcription."
